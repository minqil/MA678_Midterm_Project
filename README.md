# Midterm Project
## Introduction
Airbnb provides a rental online platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities. Because it provides users with various lodging information such as various room type, location and hosts which is different from traditional hotel industry. Therefore, I want to explore what factors are related to price. 

In this project, I downloaded data from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) which provides us with publicly available information about a city's Airbnb's listings around the world. For each city's dataset, there are 75 variables mostly about information of hosts, houses and reviews which are scraped in October, 2020. I chose 10 typical cities in United States to explore the relationship between price and other variables. The 10 cities is Boston, Chicago, Denver, Hawaii, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, Portland, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

## Guide
* The dataset I used is [airbnb.csv](https://github.com/minqil/MA678_Midterm_Project/blob/main/airbnb.csv). This dataset is not the original dataset that I subseted the data by choosing  1000 pieces of listings from each city randomly.

* The report is [Midterm_project_Minqi_Li.pdf](https://github.com/minqil/MA678_Midterm_Project/blob/main/Midterm_project_Minqi_Li.pdf) and [Midterm_project.Rmd](https://github.com/minqil/MA678_Midterm_Project/blob/main/Midterm_project.Rmd).
